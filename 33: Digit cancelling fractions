The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

    {

        {
            double product = 1;
            int a = 10, b = 10;
            for (int i = 10; i <= 99; i++)
                for (int j = i + 1; j <= 99; j++)
                {
                    if ((i % 10 == 0) && (j % 10 == 0)) // TRIVIAL CASE
                        continue;

                    if (nonTrivialCheck(i, j))
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("Found " + i + "/" + j);
                        product *= (i / (double)j);
                    }
                }
            Console.WriteLine("their product is " + product); // Happens to be 100 in the end :)
        }

        public static bool nonTrivialCheck(int numerator, int denominator)
        {
            if (numerator % 10 == denominator % 10)
                return (numerator / (double)denominator == (numerator / 10) / (double)(denominator / 10));
            if (numerator / 10 == denominator % 10)
                return (numerator / (double)denominator == (numerator % 10) / (double)(denominator / 10));
            if (numerator % 10 == denominator / 10)
                return (numerator / (double)denominator == (numerator / 10) / (double)(denominator % 10));
            if (numerator / 10 == denominator / 10)
                return (numerator / (double)denominator == (numerator % 10) / (double)(denominator % 10));
            return false; // NO SHARED DIGITS
        }


    }

Found 16/64
Found 19/95
Found 26/65
Found 49/98
their product is 0.01000000000000000

Answer is 100
