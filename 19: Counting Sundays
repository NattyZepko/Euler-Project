You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
Thirty days has September,
April, June and November.
All the rest have thirty - one,
Saving February alone,
Which has twenty - eight, rain or shine.
And on leap years, twenty - nine.
A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century(1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
