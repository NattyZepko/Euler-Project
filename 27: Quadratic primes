Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

n^2 + n + 41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0≤n≤39.
However, when n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41

is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula n2−79n + 1601
was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 0≤n≤79.
The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.
Considering quadratics of the form:

    n^2 + an + b,
 where | a |< 1000 and | b |≤1000
where | n |
is the modulus / absolute value of n
e.g. | 11 |= 11 and |−4 |= 4
Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
